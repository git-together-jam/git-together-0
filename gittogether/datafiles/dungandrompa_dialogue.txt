tony.self: The familiar look of an empty repository stood before me.
tony.self: This is where I'll spend the next week,
tony.self: developing my coding skills and making new friends.
tony.self: I am however a bit intimidated
tony.self: All the contributors are highly talented individuals specializing in different areas of code.
tony.self: But I was only let in because of the IDE skins I've made.
tony.self: Regardless, I have nothing but hope for the future!
tony.self: ...
tony.self: I let out a sigh and opened the door to the locale we'd been given to work in.
tony.self: Inside awaited me...
tony.self: a...
tony.self: ...
tony.self: ...
minty: ...
yellowaf: ...
math: Hello? Who are you? What's going on?
yosi: Ugh...
yellowaf: It would appear we've fallen asleep, and someone brought us here
minty: Yeah about that, where is here?
jxm: Welcome to the famous git-together gamejam!
tony: !!
tony: But then this has to be...
jxm: Shut up and let me speak.
jxm: You've all come here of your own free will.
jxm: Now you will make a game, of your own free will.
pope: What if I will not?
jxm: Then I will make you will it!
minty: You make me will me make it?
jxm: That's right
minty: How do me make will me make of free will it from you?
jxm: Oh it's simple really
jxm: You will make a game,
jxm: like three-in-a-row or whatever,
jxm: in in one week. Or..
jxm: I will kill you all.
tony: !!
tony: How can you say such a thing!
jxm: I said shut up and I meant it.
jxm: If you break the silence again, I'll make you the first example.
tony: ...
jxm: Any questions?
tony.self: (yes...)
math: May I ask a question?
jxm: Don't ask if you can ask a question.
jxm: There's hardly any reason to ask if you can ask when you've already asked, is there?
math: ...
math: What do we have to do to live?
jxm: Now you're asking questions I've already answered?
jxm: Make a game!
sahaun: And what is a game?
jxm: Huh? ...
jxm: You don't know what a game is?
sahaun: If my life is riding on this task, I need to know exactly how I can prevent death.
sahaun: Is Duke of Defence a game? Is Tetris a game? Is conversation a game?
jxm: ...
pope: Hah! Who would make a game about conversation?
pope: That's the lamest idea I've ever heard!
yellowaf: Even so, it is an issue that needs answering.
yellowaf: If that pug's idea of a game does not match our idea of a game,
yellowaf: we're risking a lot more than sleep without supper.
yosi: Mmh, I'm not sure we need to know what a game is to make one...
jxm: I have decided!
jxm: Figuring out what a game is will be part of your task!
yosi: ...
jxm: If you make a game that satisfies me,
jxm: You will be freed.
jxm: However, I will not judge lightly.
jxm: So, enough with this prologue, let the game begin!
tony.self: THIRD-WALL-BREAKING TIME
tony.self: Alright, so, now comes your first *nonstop debate*.
tony.self: Here, people speak consecutively, meaning text advances on its own without being clicked.
tony.self: Some of the contestants will have weakpoints in their arguments.
tony.self: These *are highlighted in orange*. You have to choose the right truth bullet to shoot at the right weakpoint.
tony.self: Oh, that's right, you'll get some number of truth bullets for each trial.
tony.self: These are statements or clues that can be used as counter arguments, shot with the left mouse button.
tony.self: If you shoot the wrong truth bullet at the wrong statement, you'll be deducted a healthpoint.
tony.self: Alright, you ready?
tony.self: No? Too bad

Games aren't real
Digital games
Educational games

sahaun: Alright, so we know he wants a game.
sahaun: But *what is a game?*
pope: That's a stupid question.
pope: It's just *something you can play*!
math: But you can play all kinds of things
minty: Like a flute
sahaun: Or a *board game*
sahaun: If a board game is considered a game
sahaun: just as much as a first person shooter
yosi: or a 3d platformer
sahaun: ...then we could simply *remake three in a row*!
yellowaf: *I don't think that's the kind of game he wants us to make*
yellowaf: We've been given a git repository
yellowaf: you *can't put a board game on a machine*.
minty: Why not?
minty: There's *nothing stopping us* from making a digital version of *Choo Choo Train - Learning Math is Fun!*
math: Except certain death.
[/NSD]
tony: No, that's wrong!
tony: If you remember from earlier when Juju spoke,
tony: he said...
jxm.self: You will make a game,
jxm.self: like *three-in-a-row* or whatever...
tony: which means a game like three-in-a-row is exactly what he wants!
minty: Hey-
math: That's right! I heard it with my own ears!
minty: Hey guys-
sahaun: So we can indeed remake three in a row!
minty: HEY GUYS!
yellowaf: What, Minty?
minty: Did you know that only 1 in 10 people know binary?
yellowaf: Huh?
yellowaf: Was that all you were screaming for?
minty: The other half doesn't. :D
pope: God dammit, you just did exactly what he wanted...
yosi: No, I think he's trying to say something.
math: Say what? Another dumb binary joke?
yosi: I fear Minty's impaired speech skills forces him to communicate in codes
minty: Haha codes
yosi: I believe what he's really trying to say, is that he doesn't quite understand what's going on.
yosi: The binary joke has the deeper meaning of 1/10 being small at a glance, 
yosi: but big when seen from another angle.
yosi: Minty may be trying to say that he will be of little help, but that with some help, he can become a lot more.
pope: Or he just likes to annoy us with his stupid jokes.
minty: Nyeh?
sahaun: Why is this even the current focus of discussion?
sahaun: I thought we were gonna make a game.
math: We have to get Minty on board before we move on.
pope: Oh for god's sake. Juju, give him the rules again.
jxm: You have two choices.
jxm: Either you make a game, and I like it, or I kill you.
minty: I still don't get it.
minty: How would you kill me?
jxm: I'll drown you.
math: But he's a penguin, don't they survive under water?
yellowaf: That's a good point.
yellowaf: It would not contribute anything other than making his fur wet.
pope: Would it, though?
pope: Sure, he'd be wet if he was taken out of the water, but he wouldn't be wet while he's under the water.
pope: An object is only wet when there is water sticking to the surface of it.
math: But there will be a whole ocean sticking to the surface of his fur
math: How does that not count as wet?

Water is wet!: 7,9
Water isn't wet!: 8,10
It's both!: 7,8,9,10

yosi: No, he's right. If you're *fully submerged* in water, 
yosi: there's *no telling you apart* from the water.
yellowaf: Of course there is. 
yellowaf: I can *poke you with a stick* under the water, 
yellowaf: and the stick would not pass through you, 
yellowaf: but it'd cut the water effortlessly.
math: Yeah, *Humans aren't liquid.*
math: *We don't just dissolve the moment we come in contact with water.*
sahaun: Maybe you don't.
pope: We may not be liquid, but *our bodies are 60% water*.
pope: 60% is way more than the amount of water that needs to stick to something to be considered wet.
pope: Which means sheer *contact alone is not enough to define wetness*.
yellowaf: Look, man. Water is wet. You can't deny it.
pope: Oh? I can't deny it huh?
yellowaf: Don't-
pope: *Water isn't wet.*
yellowaf: *Water is wet.*
yosi: *Water isn't wet.*
math: *Water is wet.*
[/NSD]
tony: No, that's wrong!
tony: Water is wet, and water is not wet.
tony: Whether water is wet or not is entirely circumstantial.
tony: In common speech, it may be logical to consider water wet, since wetness is a property based on water.
tony: Meanwhile, in a mathematical context, it may be more logical to consider water a wetting agent alone;
tony: able to wet other substances by touch, but not itself.
tony: However, in a philosophical setting, it's both.
tony: You can discuss the wetness of water eternally, and never reach a solid conclusion.

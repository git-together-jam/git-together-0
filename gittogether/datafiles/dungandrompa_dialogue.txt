tony.self: The familiar look of an empty repository stood before me.
tony.self: This is where I'll spend the next week, 
tony.self: developing my coding skills and making new friends.
tony.self: I am however a bit intimidated
tony.self: All the contributors are highly talented individuals specializing in different areas of code.
tony.self: But I was only let in because of the IDE skins I've made.
tony.self: Regardless, I have nothing but hope for the future!
tony.self: ...
tony.self: I let out a sigh and opened the door to the locale we'd been given to work in.
tony.self: Inside awaited me...
tony.self: a...
tony.self: ...

math: Hello? Who are you? What's going on?
yellowaf: It would appear we've fallen asleep, and someone brought us here
minty: Yeah about that, where is here?
jxm: Welcome to the famous git-together gamejam!
tony: !!
tony: But then this has to be...
jxm: Shut up and let me speak. 
jxm: You've all come here of your own free will.
jxm: Now you will make a game, of your own free will.
pope: What if I will not?
jxm: Then I will make you will do it!
minty: You make me will me make it?
jxm: That's right
minty: How do me make will me make of free will it from you?
jxm: Oh it's simple really
jxm: You will make a game, 
jxm: like three-in-a-row or whatever, 
jxm: in in one week. Or..
jxm: I will kill you all.
tony: !!
tony: How can you say such a thing!
jxm: I said shut up and I meant it.
jxm: If you break the silence again, I'll make you the first example.
tony: ...
jxm: Any questions?
tony.self: (yes...)
math: May I ask a question?
jxm: Don't ask if you can ask a question.
jxm: There's hardly any reason to ask if you can ask when you've already asked, is there?
math: ...
math: What do we have to do to live?
jxm: Now you're asking questions I've already answered?
jxm: Make a game!
sahaun: And what is a game?
jxm: Huh? ...
jxm: You don't know what a game is?
sahaun: If my life is riding on this task, I need to know exactly how I can prevent death.
sahaun: Is three in a row a game? Is Tetris a game? Is conversation a game?
jxm: ...
pope: Hah! Who would make a game about conversation?
pope: That's the lamest idea I've ever heard!
yellowaf: Even so, it is an issue that needs answering.
yellowaf: If that pug's idea of a game does not match our idea of a game, 
yellowaf: we're risking a lot more than sleep without supper.
jxm: I have decided!
jxm: Figuring out what a game is will be part of your task!
jxm: If you make a game that satisfies me,
jxm: You will be freed.
jxm: However, I will not judge lightly.
jxm: So, enough with this prologue, let the game begin!

sahaun: Alright, so we know he wants a game.
sahaun: But *what is a game?*
pope: That's a stupid question.
pope: It's just *something you can play*!
math: But you can play all kinds of things
minty: Like a flute
sahaun: Or a *board game*
sahaun: If a board game is considered a game 
sahaun: just as much as a first person shooter
sahaun: or an action adventure game...
sahaun: Then we could simply *remake three in a row*!
yellowaf: *I don't think that's the kind of game he wants us to make*
yellowaf: We've been given a git repository
yellowaf: you *can't put a board game on a machine*
minty: Why not?
minty: There's *nothing stopping* us from making a digital version of 
minty: *Choo Choo Train - Learn Math Fun!*
math: Except certain death.
[/NSD]
tony: No, that's wrong!
tony: If we approach this completely blindly, it may end in disaster, yes, 
tony: however, if we get stuck discussing semantics we'll never make anything!
tony: Let's make up a structure for some things like resources, management and a general game direction.
tony: Then we focus our energy on creating rather than arguing!
yellowaf: He's right. A game needs creating more than anything.
sahaun: I suppose you're right.
pope: Whatever gets you plebs working.
minty: Plebs?! What do you mean, plebs?
pope: Common folk! Infidels! Commoners! Proletariat! Sheep!
pope: Call yourselves whatever you like, just see to making that damned game already
pope: You have wasted far too much of my time.
math: Wait a minute, are you saying you won't participate?
pope: Participate? Me? Ahahaha! I am the pope!
pope: God's messenger! conqueror of discord! Master of delusion!
pope: How dare ye even think I should be involved in such lowly work as game development.
tony: But if you don't participate, we might not succeed in creating this game.
math: We'll need every participant we can have!
tony: If even just one person slacks off, we won't make it in tim-
yellowaf: I won't participate either
sahaun: What!?
tony: !!
math: !
minty: ?
yellowaf: A game needs more than just eager participants
yellowaf: It needs funding (and networking)
yellowaf: If you can't scrape together a reasonable pay to hire me, I'm afraid I won't be able to help
pope: Bwahaha, and what's a "reasonable pay" for a commoner such as yourself?
pope: $160 an hour? That's less than I spend on shaving cream!
minty: You shave?
pope: No
minty: So why do yo-
yellowaf: $250 actually
sahaun: $250!? Are you mad?
sahaun: How in the world are we to scrape together $250 x 16 x 7?
math: Do any of you even have money on you? I know I don't have any
tony: We were all gassed and brought here by surprise, I don't think anyo-
minty: I have $38700 actually
tony: What? How?
math: Careful, Tony, we don't have the full story. 
math: Minty, do you have that money with you right now
minty: No...
math: ...

Make sure you read the Instructions note in the project

Post Jam master  (New Game Plus) will act as the master branch (for now) while publishing happens. Any bug fixes, redesigns, etc. that you want to make, feel free to make edits and merge into this. If we get access to original master, we can later branch that off as the original code and merge this branch into master.

Label your branch as ngp-branchname, so we know what was made after the jam's conclusion.
